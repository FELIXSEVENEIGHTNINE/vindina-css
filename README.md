# Intro
This is a classless (or alteast semi-classless) CSS framework.

I always wanted to try creating a CSS framework and here it is.

It's inspired by other classless frameworks.

# Installation
Honestly, idk how to make an installation.

You can download css.css (and rename it) and put this in your head tag.:
```
<link href="css.css" rel="stylesheet>
```
